          <p>
            These Terms of Use explain the rules and conditions that apply when
            you access or use the platform, whether through the website, mobile
            application, or any related services. By creating an account or using
            any part of the service, you agree to follow these terms as well as
            all related policies, including those concerning privacy, cookies,
            community standards, and safety guidance. If you do not agree with
            these conditions, you should not use the platform. The company may
            revise these terms from time to time, and continued use of the
            service after updates means you accept the revised version.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Depending on where you live, your agreement may be with different
            affiliated entities that operate the service internationally, but
            throughout these terms, references to "we," "us," or "the company" all
            refer to the organization responsible for providing the platform in
            your region. The agreement applies to anyone who accesses or uses the
            service, regardless of whether they have registered an account.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Eligibility</h3>
          <p>
            To use the service, you must be an individual who is legally allowed
            to enter into a binding agreement and at least eighteen years of age.
            You must not be prohibited from using the service under applicable
            laws, and you must not be located in a jurisdiction subject to
            restrictions that prevent such use. You also confirm that you have not
            been convicted of certain serious offenses or required to register as
            a sex offender, and that you have not previously been removed from the
            platform unless you have been given permission to return. If you no
            longer meet these requirements at any point, your authorization to
            use the service ends immediately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">User Conduct</h3>
          <p>
            When using the platform, you agree to follow all applicable laws and
            platform guidelines, maintain accurate account information, safeguard
            your login credentials, and interact respectfully with others. You
            must not misrepresent your identity, interfere with the operation of
            the service, use it for unlawful or harmful purposes, or attempt to
            exploit it for fraud, harassment, or manipulation. Activities such as
            distributing malicious code, collecting other users' information
            without consent, impersonating others, reverse-engineering the
            platform, or using automated systems to access data are strictly
            prohibited. Any violation may result in suspension or termination of
            access.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Prohibited Content</h3>
          <p>
            The platform does not allow content that is offensive, abusive,
            threatening, deceptive, defamatory, discriminatory, unlawful, or
            harmful. Material that promotes violence, illegal activity, harassment,
            exploitation, or any form of harm to individuals or communities is
            forbidden. Content must respect the rights of others, including
            intellectual property and privacy rights, and must not include another
            person's likeness without permission. Sharing prohibited material may
            lead to immediate account removal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Your Content</h3>
          <p>
            You are responsible for any content you upload or share. This includes
            text, images, audio, video, profile information, or messages. You
            confirm that anything you provide is accurate and that you have the
            legal right to share it. Your content may be visible to others, and
            you should only share information you are comfortable making
            accessible. By submitting content, you grant the platform permission to
            host, store, display, and use it in connection with operating and
            improving the service. Although you retain ownership of your content,
            you allow the company to process and display it as necessary to
            provide the service and maintain platform functionality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Other Users' Content</h3>
          <p>
            You may also encounter content posted by other users. Such material
            belongs to the individuals who created it and may be inaccurate,
            misleading, or inappropriate. You should use independent judgment
            when reviewing or relying on anything shared by others. You may only
            use other users' content for purposes consistent with normal platform
            interaction and not for copying, commercial exploitation, harassment,
            or unlawful conduct.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            All remaining materials on the platform, including design elements,
            text, graphics, trademarks, and software, are owned or licensed by the
            company and protected by intellectual property laws. You receive a
            limited right to access and use these materials solely for normal use
            of the service, and this permission ends automatically if you violate
            the terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Platform Safety</h3>
          <p>
            The platform aims to maintain a respectful and safe environment, but
            it cannot guarantee the behavior or identity of any user. You are
            responsible for your interactions and should exercise caution when
            communicating with or meeting others. The company may monitor activity
            and take action, including restricting or terminating accounts, if it
            believes rules have been violated or users have acted
            inappropriately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Disclaimers</h3>
          <p>
            The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
            without guarantees that it will always function without interruption,
            error, or security risks. The company does not promise that
            information on the platform will always be accurate, complete, or
            suitable for your purposes, and it is not responsible for the
            actions, content, or conduct of users or third parties. Any use of
            the service is at your own risk, including any potential technical
            issues or data loss.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Intellectual Property Claims</h3>
          <p>
            If you believe content infringes your intellectual property rights,
            you may submit a notice identifying the material and explaining the
            claim so it can be reviewed. The company may remove material or
            restrict accounts when necessary to address such concerns or to
            comply with legal obligations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Disputes between you and the company should first be addressed
            informally by contacting customer support so both sides have an
            opportunity to resolve the matter cooperatively. If a dispute cannot
            be resolved this way, it may be handled through legally recognized
            dispute-resolution procedures. Where permitted by law, disputes will
            generally be handled individually rather than as part of a group
            claim, and applicable law may determine the location and governing
            rules.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Liability & Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to compensate and protect the company and its affiliates
            from claims arising out of your use of the service, your content, or
            your violation of these terms, to the extent allowed by law. These
            terms, together with referenced policies, form the complete agreement
            between you and the company regarding use of the service and replace
            any prior understandings. If any part of the agreement is found
            unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still apply.
