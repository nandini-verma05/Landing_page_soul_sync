            This notice explains how cookies and similar technologies function,
            why they are used, and what choices you have to manage them. If you
            only want to adjust your preferences, you can do so at any time
            through your profile or account settings, where options are available
            to modify cookie and privacy controls directly. This policy focuses
            specifically on cookies and related technologies; for broader details
            about how personal information is handled, you should review the main
            Privacy Policy.

            What Are Cookies?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or
            device when you visit a website or use an application. They usually
            contain information such as the domain they came from, how long they
            remain active, and a unique identifier. In some cases, they may also
            store device-related details, preferences, browsing activity, or usage
            patterns connected to the service.
          </p>

            Types of Cookies
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are different categories of cookies. Some are placed directly by
            the platform itself and are used, for example, to remember language
            settings or understand how visitors interact with pages. Others are
            set by partners or service providers who support features and
            functionality. Certain cookies exist only for the duration of a
            browsing session and disappear once the browser is closed, while
            others remain on the device for longer periods so that returning users
            can be recognized, preferences can be remembered, and performance can
            be analyzed over time.

            Similar Technologies
          </h3>
          <p>
            In addition to cookies, similar technologies may be used, such as
            small graphic files or code elements that help determine whether a
            page was visited or an email was opened, specialized links that show
            where traffic originates, or embedded application code that performs
            tracking functions within apps. For simplicity, all of these
            technologies are referred to collectively as cookies in this notice.

            How We Use Cookies
          </h3>
          <p>
            These tools are used to operate, maintain, and enhance the service.
            They help remember user preferences, recognize returning visitors,
            analyze how the platform is used, measure the effectiveness of
            campaigns, improve performance, and tailor content or advertising to be
            more relevant. In some situations, information gathered through these
            technologies may be combined with other data already associated with
            you in order to support these purposes.

            Cookie Categories
          </h3>
          <p>
            Certain cookies are essential for the platform to function properly,
            such as those that enable secure logins, maintain settings, or detect
            suspicious activity. Others provide insights into how features are
            used so that improvements can be made. Some support marketing and
            promotional efforts by helping determine how effective campaigns are
            and ensuring that content is displayed appropriately. Additional
            cookies may allow you to share content through social platforms or
            external services and may also assist with personalization.

            Managing Cookies
          </h3>
          <p>
            You have multiple ways to manage these technologies. Tools built into
            the platform allow you to modify preferences at any time, while many
            web browsers and devices provide settings that let you block, delete,
            or receive alerts about cookies. The exact method depends on your
            browser or device, so you may need to check its help or settings
            section for instructions. Adjusting these preferences may affect how
            the service functions, and some features may not operate fully if
            certain cookies are disabled.

            Advertising & Opt-Out
          </h3>
          <p>
            Advertising partners may also participate in industry programs that
            allow users to opt out of personalized advertising. Choosing to opt
            out does not remove advertisements entirely; instead, it limits the
            personalization of ads from participating providers. If cookies are
            cleared afterward, you may need to repeat the opt-out process.

            Third-Party Technologies
          </h3>
          <p>
            Some features rely on technologies provided by third parties, such as
            mapping or analytics services, which may store their own cookies on
            your device when those features are used. These providers manage their
            own data practices and controls through their respective systems.
            Analytics tools may also be used to collect information about how the
            website or application is accessed and used so that usage trends can
            be analyzed and improvements can be made.
